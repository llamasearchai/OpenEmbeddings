6. **Testing**: Include security testing in your test suite

## Common Security Considerations

### Model Security

- **Model Poisoning**: Be cautious with untrusted models
- **Adversarial Inputs**: Validate inputs to prevent adversarial attacks
- **Model Extraction**: Protect proprietary models from unauthorized access

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Authentication**: Use strong authentication for API access
- **Input Validation**: Validate all API inputs
- **CORS**: Configure CORS properly for web applications

### Data Security

- **Data Privacy**: Handle user data according to privacy regulations
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Access Logs**: Monitor and log access to sensitive operations
- **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies

## Security Tools

We use the following security tools in our development process:

- **Bandit**: Static security analysis for Python
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning
- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

## Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we greatly appreciate security researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly. We will:

- Acknowledge your contribution publicly (if desired)
- Provide a timeline for fixes
